# A 3D Printable Polypharmacy Kit
This is designed to be a sustainable and self-managed version of polypharmacy services by MedPack, PillPack, SimpleDose, etc.

I needed to create this because all of these services have shut down (or become significantly worse) due to late-stage capitalism, enshittification, and unsustainable business practices.
The goal is to have a whole system that functions like PillPack, but wastes less plastic and involves less robots.

This is an elaborate remix of [TOXXIC407's Pill Organizer](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6817349), but significantly smaller (60%) in size and a few extra parts.
This was tested on a FlashForge Adventurer 5M Pro using natural PLA and Food Safe PLA printed at .12mm Fine Settings with 15% infill. 

I recommend using certified Food Safe PLA for obvious reasons, but I'm not a doctor or a lawyer, so you print at your own risk.
I'm mostly posting this because I have a habit of deleting and overwriting project STL files.

# Instructions
1. Download the pillbox_daybase.stl and monday.stl files
2. Verify that the size is what you want. (This can hold about 9 small RX tablets, but you may have bigger pills.)
3. Scale up as needed. (This is as small as possible, increasing the scale should work without much issue.)
4. Print the base and Monday lid on your 3D printer. Verify that things fit together the way you want.
5. Print 30 more bases
6. Print 3 more Monday lids, print 4 Tuesday lids, 4 Wednesday lids, etc. until you have 28 lids for 28 bases.
7. Print 4 casettes and 4 casette lids
8. (Optional) Print a blank lid for an extra day.
9. (Optional) Print 1-4 medtrays to help with refilling or acting as a 1-week home caddy.

# Assembly and Use 
1. Slide your lid on to each box and make sure no box is cracked. I recommend assembling each box right as the lid finishes printing to minimize warping.
2. Each casette holds one week of medication in a small pocket sized box. (Consider printing a label with RX numbers and medication names for travel)
3. Neatly stack 7 days, with the first day at the bottom. Slowly slide the casette over 7 days, then tilt and close with the lid.
4. Dispense by removing the lid and tilting toward your hand like you would serve candy. Each day should dispense individually from the casette almost like a pez dispenser, but using gravity.
5. Repeat this 4 times to produce 4 casettes with 28 days of pre-sorted medication
6. (Optional) Use a [tilt or vibration sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-Vibration-Sensor-Automation-Compatible/dp/B07PJT939B/) to track and verify medication compliance
